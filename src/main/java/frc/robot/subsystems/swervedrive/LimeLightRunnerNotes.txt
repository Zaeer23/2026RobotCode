Limelight.java command objective is to...

1. Check if apriltag exist
2. Rotate until centered (tx -> 0)
3. Drive Forward slowly
4. Let joystick adjust speed (your welcome Cade)

LightRunner mainly implements the functionality

Main Instructions:

  >   Hook LimeLight.java to RobotContainer.java

private final LimeLight limelight = new LimeLight("limelight");
  
  >   Then bind to a button
  
driverController.a().whileTrue(
    new LimeLightRunner(
        limelight,
        swerveSubsystem,
        () -> driverController.getLeftY()
    )
);

>   This should make it so that Holding the A button would 
    have the robot self-asign on AprilTag/Cade and driver 
    will control speed slightly.
    


>   For Debugging. Change in Line 52 of LimeLightRunner.java

swerve.drive(finalForward, 0, turn, true);

>   To the following, because it uses drive(Translation2d translation, double rotation, boolean fieldRelative)

swerve.drive(new Translation2d(finalForward, 0),   turn,   true);



>   Some additional tip bits

tv	target visible (0 or 1)
tx	horizontal offset from crosshair
ty	vertical offset
ta	target area
tid	AprilTag ID

tx  → turning correction
ta or ty → forward distance estimate
